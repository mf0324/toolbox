Though dlib provides example programs with a CMakeLists.txt script, however, it is not very easy to use that.

Instead, I think a very very tiny hello world cmake script is needed, and it should be run either on windows or ubuntu.

Part of this is inspired from `https://www.learnopencv.com/install-dlib-on-windows/`, but this script is easier that: you don't have to create envirionment in "control panel"->"user enviroment variables". Instead, it is created in the cmakelists.txt
